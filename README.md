# Hi, I'm Jm

**Data Scientist & AI Engineer** building intelligent systems that bridge ML research and production.

---

## About Me

I design and build AI systems that solve real problems -- from evaluation frameworks that measure what matters to production pipelines that scale. My work spans traditional machine learning foundations through modern AI engineering: RAG systems, agentic orchestration, LLM evaluation, compound AI, and context engineering.

Currently based in **San Diego, CA** and open to **Data Scientist** and **AI Engineer** opportunities.
